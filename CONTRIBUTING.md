### 3. Running tests

__Running unit tests:__

### 4. Testing with a local Java/Scala project

To test local changes against a java project, it is sometimes useful to publish the
artifact locally, and then bring those changes into your `gradle` or `sbt` project. 

__To publish locally:__

```
# From project root directory
./sbt publishLocal
```

---
### 5. Updating the Documentation

To test/view changes to the documentation, simply use `sbt`.

__Generate API documentation:__

```
# From project root directory
./sbt clean doc
```

The `index.html` page of the documentation should be located in your project root
directory, under `target/scala-2.13/api`.

### 6. Running benchmarks

To run, benchmarks on a single thread: 
`./sbt "bench/jmh:run -i 1 -wi 1 -f 1 -t 1"` or
`./sbt "bench/jmh:run -bm ss -lrf"`.
